     In CPP iterator - vector.begin() gives the memory position/adress at the 0-th element of vector
     
     *iterator gives value at memory position/adress 

     Lower bound works as this >= sign:
     1)If target value is present in sorted vector it points iterator to that value(If there are 
     multiple target values it will point iterator to that value memory of first occurance)
     2)Else it will point out iterator to the memory of that first value which will be greater than target value.
     3)If target value is greater than the last element it will point iterator to the next empty memory of last value
     Ex:
        0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        3  5 5 5 5 7 8 9
        If target is 7 it will point to the memory of index : 5
        If target is 6 it will point to the memory of index : 5
        If target is 5 it will point to the memory of index : 1
        If target is 10 it will point to the memory of index : 8
     (*)Iterator - v.begin gives index position of that number.
     (*)If iterator points out to the next empty memory of last index of the array, *iterator will crash
